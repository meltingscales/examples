// I have always wondered why we have getters and setters.

// If you can modify an object's variable, i.e. 'Obj.x = 3.4', directly,
// Why the hell should we make an extra function to do it for us?

// Just for completion, below is a class WITHOUT a setter.

final class Thing
{
    public Thing thing;
}

// It doesn't help that most setters look like this:

final class Thing2
{
    private Thing2 thing;

    public void setThing(Thing2 t)
    {
        this.thing = t; // Why not just make 'thing' public?!?!
    }
}

// And...that's it. Why use it?

// If you want to strictly control exactly how your object's
// instance variables are modified, then that's when you'd use it.

// For example, with the 'thing' class I made above, suppose you
// have created a new Exception that you wish to throw if someone
// passes in a Thing that is actually `null`?

// The easiest way this can be ensured is just to force yourself to
// use a `setThing(...)` method that checks if the passed argument
// is null, and throws that exception.

// Example of this 'checking' for not null.
// Note: you can check if things are positive, negative, zero, etc.
// Whatever you might want to do to prevent an object being created
// with data you don't want it to have is totally possible.

 * Thrown when someone passes you something that is totally wack.
